If you're interested in a specific pet, please reach out to the adoption group that has that pet.\n    </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <h3>Will There Be An Adoption Fee?</h3>\n    <p>\n        Petfinder doesn't dictate adoption group policy, including adoption requirements and fees. If you're interested in a specific pet, please contact the adoption group that created the pet listing through the Pet Profile page or Member Home Page.\n    </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <h3>Why Do Shelters and Rescue Groups Charge Adoption Fees?</h3>\n    <p>\n        Adoption fees help cover the medical care of the animal while he or she waits for a new home, as well as food and transportation costs. These fees help to provide care for the other animals in the shelter or rescue group who may have medical bills that are much higher than any possible adoption fee. The money also acts as a donation to help support the organization as a whole, allowing the group to continue its efforts to rescue and rehome pets.\n    </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <h3>Why Wasn't I Selected to Adopt?</h3>\n    <p>\n        Thank you for thinking adoption first! Each shelter and rescue group has its own adoption process. We do not dictate adoption procedures to our Petfinder members, although we do encourage them to do everything possible to facilitate finding good homes for their adoptable pets.\n    </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <h3>How Can I Tell If a Rescue Group is Real or a Scam?</h3>\n    <p>\n        All the adoption groups that list their pets on Petfinder have been carefully screened by our shelter outreach staff. If you have concerns about a shelter or rescue group listed on Petfinder, please contact us.\n    </p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <h3>How Do I Make a Complaint About a Shelter or Rescue Group?</h3>\n    <p>\n        All of the animal shelters and rescue groups on our site undergo an application and screening process prior to being able to post their group's adoptable pets. If you have concerns about a particular shelter or rescue group posting on our site, you are welcome to contact us. Please be sure to include the full name, city, and state of the group you are referring to.\n    </p>\n    </li>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default
